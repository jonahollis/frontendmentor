## My process

was simple! I worked up the index.html file semantically in html and tackled the simple CSS properties one by one.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project was useful to perform pixel perfect development without having to worry about the given design elements such as color scheme and images.

### Continued development

I focused more on responsive elements in this project, however moving forward I'd like to stick to the prompts when specifying for static elements such as defined viewports.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is a great resource for quick snippets and CSS reminders.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is an amazing resource for more in-depth knowledge when researching CSS topics.
