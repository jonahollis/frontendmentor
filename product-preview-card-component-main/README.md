## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how much more complicated it is to style SVG components than you might imagine and all the different ways you can approach it.

### Continued development

I'd like to explore further how to create responsive layouts without the use of media queries in addition to mastering my hand at SVG styling.
